You are able to authenticate yourself with your GitHub user against **Bitrise**. It brings some practical benefits, like logging in with one click and of course you won't have to authorize your GitHub account when adding repositories hosted by these providers again.

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Signing up with email address" content=" If you'd like to sign up with your email address, please follow the instructions in [signing up with email address](/getting-started/signing-up/signing-up-with-email). "%}

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Trial after signing up" content="If you sign up for a free account, you will automatically be granted a two-week trial on our Developer plan. This includes:

* 45 minutes of build time.
* 1000 builds a month.
* A maximum of 100 team members.

Read more about the available plans on the [Pricing](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing/teams) page!"%}

## Signing up

1. Go to the Sign up page by clicking `Sign up!` on the landing page of [bitrise.io](https://bitrise.io).

2. Select `GitHub` for authenticating yourself with this service.

## Authorizing Bitrise

You have to authorize Bitrise before we can establish the connection. This means you give permission to Bitrise to access (read) your repositories.

If you press the `Authorize application` button, you will be redirected to Bitrise.

## Finishing signup

You will have to pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account. This way you are free from relying on the given service’s availability, you are also able to connect more accounts, GitHub **and** Bitbucket, for example. Last, but not least, you don’t have to stick to your connected account’s username.

1. Pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account on the `You are almost there` page.

   Please note that you must provide a **strong password** which fulfills these requirements:
   * It should have at least 12 characters.
   * At least one upper case character.
   * At least one lower case character.
   * At least one number.
   * Can not contain the same character more than 3 times in a row (aaa).
   * Cannot be alphabetical order or reverse order (abcd, dcba).
   * Cannot be numerical order or reverse order (1234, 4321).
2. On the `Help us help you` page add your first name, last name, your company name and a few more details if you wish. You can also add those later.

After that, you are ready to roll. Add your first app on your Dashboard!
