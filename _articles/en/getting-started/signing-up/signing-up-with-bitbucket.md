You are able to authenticate yourself with your Bitbucket user against **Bitrise**. It brings some practical benefits, like logging in with one click and you won't have to authorize your Bitbucket account every time when adding repositories hosted by Bitbucket.

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Signing up with email address" content="If you'd like to sign up with your email address, please follow the instructions in [signing up with email address](/getting-started/signing-up/signing-up-with-email). "%}

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Trial after signing up" content="If you sign up for a free account, you will automatically be granted a two-week trial on our Developer plan. This includes:

* 45 minutes of build time
* 1000 builds a month
* a maximum of 100 team members

Read more about the available plans on the [Pricing](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing/teams) page!"%}

## Sign up

Go to the Sign up page by clicking `Sign up!` on the landing page of [bitrise.io](https://bitrise.io).

Select `Bitbucket` for authenticating yourself with this service.

## Authorizing Bitrise

You have to authorize Bitrise before we can establish the connection. This means you give permissions to Bitrise to access (read) your repositories.

If you press the `Grant access` button, you will be redirected to Bitrise.

## Finish signup

You will have to pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account. This way you are free from relying on the given service’s availability, you are also able to connect more accounts, GitHub **and** Bitbucket, for example. Last, but not least, you don’t have to stick to your connected account’s username.

1. Pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account on the `You are almost there` page.

   Please note that you must provide a **strong password** which fulfills these requirements:
   * it should have at least 12 characters
   * at least one upper case character
   * at least one lower case character
   * at least one number
   * can not contain the same character more than 3 times in a row (aaa)
   * cannot be alphabetical order or reverse order (abcd, dcba)
   * cannot be numerical order or reverse order (1234, 4321)
2. On the `Help us help you` page add your first name, last name, your company name and a few more details if you wish. You can also add those later.

After that, you are ready to roll. Add your first app on your Dashboard!
