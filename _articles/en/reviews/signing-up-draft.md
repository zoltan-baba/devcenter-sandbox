You can authenticate yourself with your GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab user against Bitrise. It brings some practical benefits, like logging in with one click and of course you won't have to authorize your Git account when adding repositories hosted by these providers again. You can of course sign up to Bitrise using your email address as well, and log in through your user credentials.

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Trial after signing up" content="If you sign up for a free account, you will automatically be granted a two-week trial on our Developer plan. This includes:

* 45 minutes of build time.
* 1000 builds a month.
* A maximum of 100 team members.

## Authorizing Bitrise with a Git provider

You have to authorize Bitrise before we can establish the connection. This means you give permission to Bitrise to access (read) your repositories.

### GitHub

If you press the **Authorize** button on Gitlab, you will be redirected to Bitrise.

## Finishing signup

You will have to pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account. This way you are free from relying on the given service’s availability, and you are also able to connect more accounts. Last, but not least, you don’t have to stick to your connected account’s username.

1. Pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account on the **You are almost there** page.

   Please note that you must provide a **strong password** which fulfills these requirements:
   * It should have at least 12 characters.
   * At least one upper case character.
   * At least one lower case character.
   * At least one number.
   * Can not contain the same character more than 3 times in a row (aaa).
   * Cannot be alphabetical order or reverse order (abcd, dcba).
   * Cannot be numerical order or reverse order (1234, 4321).
2. On the **Help us help you page** add your first name, last name, your company name and a few more details if you wish. You can also add those later.

After that, you are ready to roll. Add your first app on your Dashboard!

From now on, you are able to log in with a click of a button. Choose your favorite!
