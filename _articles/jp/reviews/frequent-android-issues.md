In this guide we aim to address the most frequent Android error messages and the solution(s) to them.

## 1. "Could not find an android package" or "you have not accepted the license agreements"

### Error

    > A problem occurred configuring project ':lib'.
       > You have not accepted the license agreements of the following SDK components:
         [Google Repository].
         Before building your project, you need to accept the license agreements and complete the installation of the missing components using the Android Studio SDK Manager.
         Alternatively, to learn how to transfer the license agreements from one workstation to another, go to http://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/export-licenses.html

or

    Could not find com.android.support:appcompat-v7:24.2.0.

### Solution 1

The above error messages mean that your build requires an Android package which is either not installed or outdated. You also have to take care of accepting those licenses agreements for the SDK tools. If the accepted license agreements and/or SDK components are missing from your project, you won't be able to build your project.

We advise you to use our `Install missing Android SDK components` and add it to your workflow. Make sure you insert this Step right before any build or test step and those steps rely on the outcome of the dependency Step. If you keep getting the same error messages despite using our `Install missing Android SDK` Step, have a look at **Solution 2** below.

### Solution 2

This solution uses our `Do anything with Script` Step. Let's see how!

1. Create an `android-licenses` directory in the root directory of your git repository.
2. Copy the license files into this directory from your computer.
3. Add a `Do anything with Script` Step **after** the `Git Clone Repository` Step.
4. Add the script to the `Script content` input field, for example:

       #!/bin/bash
       
       # fail if any commands fails
       
       set -e
       
       # debug log
       
       set -x
       
           
       
       # For newer Android SDK:
       
       sdkmanager "extras;android;m2repository"
       
       sdkmanager "extras;google;m2repository"
       
           
       
       # For older Android SDK:
       
       echo y | android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter extra-android-m2repository | grep 'package installed'
       
       echo y | android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter extra-google-m2repository | grep 'package installed'

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="List of preinstalled packages" content=" You can see which packages are preinstalled on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/android/blob/master/Dockerfile#L30). Feel free to send us a PR if you'd like to add a new preinstalled package! We update the preinstalled Android packages every weekend so if the error is related to an outdated package, the workaround we describe here can be removed from your build after the weekend update is completed. " %}

**In most cases you don't need both packages to be updated, so you can try to remove them one by one, but having all three in the script covers most of the cases related to this error.**

## 2. "Could not download project dependency" - error message

### Error

The error is related to a temporary network issue at Bintray/jcenter.

### Solution

Since the issue is not related to Bitrise, we advise you to:

1. Check [Bintray jcenter](https://status.bintray.com)'s service status page.
2. Wait until the issue is resolved on their side.
3. Rebuild your project.

## 3. "Could not find intellij-core.jar"

If you experience the following error message, it is most likely related to jcenter. You most likely have started using a more recent version of Gradle but your project has not been updated accordingly.

    Could not resolve all files for configuration ‘:classpath’.
    Could not find intellij-core.jar (com.android.tools.external.com-intellij:intellij-core:26.0.1).
    Searched in the following locations:
    https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/android/tools/external/com-intellij/intellij-core/26.0.1/intellij-core-26.0.1.jar 5

### Solution

Resolve the issue by editing the repository section of your `build.gradle` in the root of your repository so that `google()` is the first entry there.

As an example:

    repositories {
      google()
      mavenCentral()
      jcenter()
    }

## 4. "I Cannot start android emulator"

### Error

You cannot start the android emulator if the `Create Android emulator` or `Start Android emulator` Steps have not been properly set.

### Solution

We advise you to use `AVD Manager` Step instead of having to set the `Create Android emulator` and `Start Android emulator` Steps individually. `AVD Manager` performs all the other two steps, meaning it creates and starts the emulator at the same time. If you want to control when the emulator should kick in, use our `Wait for Android emulator` Step. Check out our guide on [Emulators](/tips-and-tricks/android-tips-and-tricks/#emulators) for more information!

## 5. "Keystore file not found for signing config"

### Error

The `Sign APK` Step prints out the above error message if you have not uploaded your keystore file to the `ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE` section of the `Code Signing` tab.

### Solution

1. Go to the `Code Signing` tab of your Workflow Editor.
2. Upload your keystore file (drag and drop it ) to the `ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE` field.
3. Set your `keystore password`, `keystore alias`, and `private key password`.
4. Rebuild your project.

Check out our [Android code signing guide](/code-signing/android-code-signing/android-code-signing-procedures/) for more information.

## 6. "Signature mismatching"

### Error

The "Signature mismatching" error implies that the app apk and the test apk have not been matched with their right code signing key, that is different keys have been used  for the app and for the debug APKs. In this case your virtual device test will not run and you will not have any results available on your Dashboard.

Your app APK is signed with a release key (or with nothing) while your debug APK is signed with a debug key. Your goal is to have these two APKs signed with the same key. If they are signed with different keys, your build will fail. The bottom line is your app APK and your debug APK cannot be signed with different keys.

### Solution

You have to match the build type with the Gradle Runner tasks of your app APK and your debug APK.

assembleRelease and assembleDebugAndroidTest (two different types of APKs)

assembleDebug and assembleDebugAndroidTest

## 7. "Invalid" ??

This is error is related to virtual device testing and might result in a completely blank Dashboard.

### Error

If you get the "Invalid" error message in your build log, it is most likely related to virtual device test, meaning, it could not start the test. That's why you cannot see any test result in your Dashboard. It is related to the `assemble` Gradle task which generates all variants of your project, but using our filter option you can define which APK you want to export out of all generated variants.

### Solution

Make sure you match the APKs based on their variant type using the `Gradle Runner` step.

1. In `Gradle Runner` Step, you can use the `APK file include filter` and the `Test APK file include filter` step input fields to circumvent the mismatched signatures.
2. Go to the `Export Config` section of `Gradle Runner` Step.
3. Specify the filter. This filter is a standard find commands -path pattern, see: [http://linux.die.net/man/1/find](http://linux.die.net/man/1/find "http://linux.die.net/man/1/find") All APKs that have this filter in their file name will be copied to the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

## 8. "Gitignored config.json file"

### Error

Build cannot run until the config.json file is not included in your repository. Config.json file is usually gitignored in your own repository since it comes from...

### Solution

Make sure you include it into your repository.

## 9. "Version of this app can not be downloaded by any devices as they will all receive APKs with higher version codes"

### Error

The issue is related to an APK which has a higher versionCode on a lower track than another APK with lower versionCode but in a higher track.

### Solution

To resolve the issue, you have to deactivate higher APK version.

1. In `Google Play Deploy` Step, check if the `Untrack blocking version` is set to `true` value.

If the input field has the `true` value set, the Step will automatically deactivate every APK with lower version code on lower level tracks.
