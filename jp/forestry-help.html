<h3 id="creating-new-articles-with-forestry">Creating new articles with Forestry</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">For review</code> section of the sidebar.</li>
  <li>Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Add new</code> on the top of the screen.</li>
  <li>Choose a Front Matter Template. In most cases, the <strong>basic template</strong> works perfectly.</li>
  <li>Add some content to the editor on the right, and click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save draft</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can come back and edit the article any time. Please remember that every time you click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save</code>, Forestry pushes a commit to GitHub. You can view your file in the DevCenter repository.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please make sure when your article is ready for review that a single commit on GitHub makes all changes visible. With a new article, that means you should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cut its entire content (keep it on the clipboard!) and then click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save draft</code></li>
  <li>Once it is saved (the little circle is green), paste the content back in and click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save draft</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This way you will have a commit that will show the entire content of the article as new content. Voilá!</p>

<h3 id="updating-an-existing-article">Updating an existing article</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new article in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">For review</code> section.</li>
  <li>Copy the contents of the existing article into the new article.</li>
  <li>Add your changes.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please make sure when your article is ready for review that a single commit on GitHub makes all changes visible. With an existing article this means you should make sure that all your changes are added with a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save</code>.</p>

<h3 id="getting-an-article-reviewed">Getting an article reviewed</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Save the article on Forestry - this creates a commit on GitHub so only save on Forestry when your content is ready for review.</li>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/bitrise-io/devcenter/commits/master">commits page of the DevCenter repository</a> and find the commit or commits created when you saved the article. Its commit message should be “Updated article-name.md” or “Created article-name.md”.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: if you have several articles ready for review, you will find each article in a separate commit.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select and copy the links of the commits in your browser’s address bar and add them to the review task(s) in ClickUp.</li>
  <li>Move your writing tasks to <em>Blocked</em> status.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="publishing-an-article">Publishing an article</h3>

<p>Once the review is done and the article is approved, we are ready to publish.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy the contents of the article in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">For review</code> section in to the article in its “proper” place. For example, if you edited the <em>Quick Start Guide to Bitrise</em> article, copy the content from the article in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">For review</code> section to the article in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Getting started</code> section.</li>
  <li>If the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Draft</code> setting is <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON</code>, turn it off. Once it’s off, click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>And done! Forestry will push your article into the repository and GitHub pages will build it.</p>

<h3 id="note-info-warning">Note, info, warning</h3>

<p>Forestry supports using snippets to quickly add shortcodes to your content. In our case, the snippets include all message boxes which are HTML codes inserted directly into the content, parsed when building the site.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can only insert snippets from the WYSIWYG editor.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Place the cursor where you wish to insert a message box.</li>
  <li>Open the Snippets menu on the bottom toolbar.</li>
  <li>Select the type of message box you need.</li>
  <li>Enter the title of your message between the quotation marks after <code class="highlighter-rouge">title=.</code></li>
  <li>Enter the content of your message between the quotation marks after <code class="highlighter-rouge">content=</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and tricks</h3>

<h4 id="the--tag">The  tag</h4>

<p>Jekyll is built on the Liquid templating language and therefore tries to parse anything within double curly brackets {{ such as this }}. The result is the content within simply will not appear once the site is built.</p>

<p>The workaround is to use the {% raw %} tag to indicate to Jekyll that nothing within the tag needs to be parsed. Like this:</p>

<p>{% raw %}</p>

<p>Please, {{ Jekyll }}, just display everything, brackets and all here.</p>

<p>Of course, this works for any formatting that might be lost otherwise when the site is built.</p>
